## Using this asset

### Installing android build templates

The use of a Godot Android plugin requires the use of the gradle build option in Godot:
- Open your Godot XR project in Godot
- Open the `Project` menu
- Select `Install Android Build templates`

### Copying the plugin into place

When downloading this asset from Godot's asset library it should place the required files into 
the `addons`directory.
If you've downloaded the zip file from the releases page, copy the files in `asset/addons` 
manually to `addons` in your project. You may need to create the `addons` folder.

If you have build the asset from source, you need to create the `addons` folder in your project 
if it doesn't exist already, and then copy the content of the `demo/addons` folder to `addons` 
in your project.

Once the asset is added to your project, navigate to `Project` -> `Project Settings...` -> `Plugins` 
and enable the plugin. 

### Configuring your export

Back in Godot open the `Project` menu and select `Export...`:
- If it doesn't already exist, create an Android export configuration by pressing `Add...` and 
selecting `Android`
- Tick the `Use Gradle Build` tickbox
- Select `OpenXR` as the **XR Mode** under the **XR Features** section
- Enable the XR vendor you need to use
- Scroll down to the bottom to see additional features for specific platforms.

**Note:**
**Do not** select multiple vendors in the same export template!
You can instead create multiple export templates, one for each vendor.
