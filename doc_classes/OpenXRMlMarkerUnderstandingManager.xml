		Provides an easy-to-use way to interact with Magic Leap's Marker.
		Markers are detected by adding [OpenXRMlMarkerDetector] nodes to the scene tree.
		This node instantiates a scene to represent the virtual objects located at those markers. Each instantiated scene will be added as a child of an [XRAnchor3D] node that will be positioned using tracking data from the headset.
