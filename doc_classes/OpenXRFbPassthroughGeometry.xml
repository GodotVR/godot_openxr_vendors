			Enables a technique called "hole punching", which removes anything rendered by Godot that would appear behind the mesh.
			This can be used to create the illusion that the passthrough exists in the same 3D space as everything rendered by Godot, allowing objects to appear to pass both behind or in front of the passthrough.
