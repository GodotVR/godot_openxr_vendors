Patches for godot-cpp
=====================

Place any `*.patch` files in this directory, in order for CI to automatically
apply them to our copy of godot-cpp.

They will be applied in alphabetical order, so you can name them with a leading
number in order to ensure the proper order, for example:

- `001-scons-cache-fix.patch`
- `002-some-other-fix.patch`
- etc...
